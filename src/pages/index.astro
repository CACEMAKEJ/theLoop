      The Loop
    </h1>

    <p class="text-slate-300">
      “The Loop” explores how social media algorithms influence the behaviour,
      mental health, and decision-making of young adults (18–25). It breaks
      down the ethics behind personalised feeds, doomscrolling, FOMO, and
      platform design choices.

    <p class="text-slate-400">
      This website acts as a digital artefact for understanding the ethical
      and legal implications of social media platforms. It combines research
      findings, case studies, and practical solutions for healthier digital
      habits.
